# Notepad

Browser based notepad. Based on something I found somewhere around the internet.

Features:

- Create, edit, delete notes on the fly
- Save notes to local storage
- Restore notes from local storage when opening new window

That's it.

## Development

Edit index.html. Open index.html in browser.

## Todo

Wait until it works on mobile (Webkit I'm looking at you).

Browse to index.html.
