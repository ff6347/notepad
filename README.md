# Notepad

Browser based notepad. Based on something I found somewhere around the internet.

Features:

- Create, edit, delete notes on the fly
- Save notes to local storage
- Restore notes from local storage when opening new window

That's it.

Possible enhancements:

- markdown support
- blocknote https://www.blocknotejs.org/
- tabs

## Known Issues

- User has to know to tap into the frame to see the cursor


## Development

Edit index.html. Open index.html in browser.

## Todo

- Wait until this works on mobile (Webkit I'm looking at you). https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/VirtualKeyboard_API
- maybe make it use the body again?

## Ideas

- Tabs of different notes 

## Deployment

Copy index.html to your web server.
Browse to index.html.
